    option1: "4 days",
    option2: "6 days",
    option3: "8 days",
    option4: "12 days",
    ans: 3,
    explanation: "Work done by (A + B + C) in 1 day = \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).<br>Work done by (A + B) in 1 day = \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).<br>Work done by (B + C) in 1 day = \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\).<br>Therefore, Work done by A in 1 day = (A+B+C)'s - (B+C)'s = \\( \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{12} \\).<br>Work done by C in 1 day = (A+B+C)'s - (A+B)'s = \\( \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{24} \\).<br>Work done by (A + C) in 1 day = \\( \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{3}{24} = \\frac{1}{8} \\).<br>So, A and C together will do the work in 8 days."

Correct. It is reverse order, then +1 (immediate next letter), but keeping the first and last same? No, purely reverse then +1 logic.<br>Let's check: C->D? No, C becomes C at end? No. <br>Actually: Reverse the word: RETUPMOC. Then +1 to first (R)?? No. <br>Correct Logic: Reverse the word logic is often simpler. <br>Let's try: C(first) -> C(last).

Reverse of MEDICINE is ENICIDEM. <br>E -> E (Same?), N->O (+1), I->J(+1), C->D(+1), I->J(+1), D->E(+1), E->F(+1), M->M(Same). <br>Therefore, first and last letters remain same, others +1 in reverse order."
